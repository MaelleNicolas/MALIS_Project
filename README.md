This is a project on Pneumonia detection from chest X-Ray images. This project was part of my Malis Learning class following at EURECOM in Fall 2020 and received an honorable mention from the jury. https://malis-course.github.io/2020/11/22/final-projects/


When you have download the code, please put the folder "chest x_ray" with all the data in the same folder as the Code_pneumonia_detection.ipynb file.
You might have to download some libraries to make the code work.
All our code is in the Code_pneumonia_detection.ipynb file.
